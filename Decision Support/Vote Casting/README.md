# Pairwise Comparison Methods

This project provides graphical user interfaces for several pairwise comparison methods, including:

- Метод Борда (Borda method)
- Метод Борда Мод (Borda count modified method)
- Метод Кондорсе (Condorcet method)
- Метод Доджсона (Dodgson's method)
- Метод Симпсона (Simpson's method)
- Метод Нансена (Nanson's method)
- Метод Коупленда (Copeland's method)
- Метод Фишберна (Fishburn's method)od

These methods are based on pairwise comparisons of the candidates, and each method uses a different algorithm to determine a winner.
